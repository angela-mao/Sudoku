# Sudoku
This is a GUI application coded with Java which allows the player to choose between three levels of Sudoku puzzles. Each puzzle, easy, medium and hard, gives the player 3 chances to successfully solve it. There is a restart button in case the player would like to start over. On the main page, there is a progress bar as well which shows how many levels the player has successfully solved.
